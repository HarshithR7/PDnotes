#### 1. **Initialize Git (if not already done)**

You may have already done this, but to be safe:

```bash
git init
```

---

#### 2. **Add a branch (use `main` as GitHub expects)**

```bash
git checkout -b main
```

---

#### 3. **Add all files**

```bash
git add .
```

---

#### 4. **Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

### **Github account add**

```bash
 git config --global user.email "harshithreddy18@gmail.com"
 git config --global user.name "HarshithR7"

```
#### 5. **Add the remote**

(Only do this once)

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/HarshithR7/32_MIPS.git  // if already 

or
git remote add origin https://github.com/HarshithR7/32bit_mips_processor.git
```

---

#### 6. **Push to GitHub**

```bash
git push -u origin main
```


✅ Step-by-Step to Recover the Lost Work
🔍 1. Check the commit you made before the pull
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git reflog
Look for a line like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
abc1234 HEAD@{1}: commit: WIP: local changes before rebase
That abc1234 is the commit hash of your lost work. It’s still in your Git object database!

🔄 2. Recover that commit
To restore your lost files to your working directory, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout abc1234
(Replace abc1234 with the actual hash you saw in reflog)

This will switch your working directory to that commit, and all your files should be back.

💾 3. Create a new branch to save the recovered state (highly recommended)
To avoid losing this again:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b recovered-wip
Now you're on a safe branch with your recovered changes.
