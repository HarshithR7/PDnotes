Higher Transition times increase dynamic power dissipation
slower transitions affect signal integrity with glitches or timing violations
poor transition can result in higher coupling noise.
Stronger driving strength of cell, long interconnects increase resistance reduce transition time, higher load capacitance Increase it.

Use stronger buffers/drivers, reduce load capacitance by optimizing net fanout, optimize PnR to minimize wire resistance&capacitance.
