* Loading the design  and parses code into an Abstract syntax tree(AST)- `yosys fifo.v`

* `read_verilog -D ICE40_HX -lib -specify +/ice40/cells_sim.v`  - loads the iCE40 cell models which allows us to include platform specific IP blocks in our design.

* `hierarchy -check -top <top>` - declare a top level module , discard remaining .

*`proc` -  these sub-commands work to convert the behavioral logic of processes into multiplexers and registers. we also use `proc -noopt` to prevent some automatic optimizations.
* intial block is not synthesizable so we use `opt_expr;clean`
