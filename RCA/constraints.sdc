# No clocks since design is combinational

# Define input and output delays relative to an external clock if you have one,
# else just specify input/output delays for timing analysis.

# If you have a testbench clock or timing reference, define it here:
# (If no clock exists, you can comment these out.)

# create_clock -name clk -period 10.0 [get_ports clk]

# Input delays (assuming external launch clock period of 10 ns)
