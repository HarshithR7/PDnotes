# Clock Tree Synthesis
CTS ensures uniform distribution of clock signals to all sequential elements with in a chip. It involves buffers or inverters along the clock path to balance skew and minimize insertion delay.

Multi Point CTS distributes clock signal by having multiple clock sources or insertion points.

Clock latency is the time delay between clock source and sequential element.
