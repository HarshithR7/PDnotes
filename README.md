# Yosys - https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/introduction.html
Yosys is used for synthesis in the ASIC Design flow targetting the SkyWater 130nmmPDK. Yosys is a Verilog HDL synthesis tool. This means that it takes a behavioural design description as input and generates an RTL, logical gate or physical gate level description of the design as output. Yosysâ€™ main strengths are behavioural and RTL synthesis.we can couple yosys with place and route tool nextpnr with fully end-to-end FPGA Design flow(Lattice iCE40 and ECP5).
* A commercial extension, Tabby CAD Suite, includes the Verific frontend for industry-grade SystemVerilog and VHDL support, formal verification with SVA, and formal apps.
# What Yosys can do
* Perform logic optimizations(https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/using_yosys/synthesis/opt.html) and gate mapping(Translating optimized logic into a form that can be implemented on a target architecture) with ABC (A Berkeley Compiler).
* Read and process modern verilog-2005 code.
* perform all kinds of operations on netlist.
